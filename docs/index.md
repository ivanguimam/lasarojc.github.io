Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I work as Principal Engineer for Hedvig, a Commvault Venture, and as an Associate Professor for the Computer Science Faculty @ Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia, where I co-founded the [Distributed Systems and Networks research group](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedsystemsandnetworks/members).

Previously I have also worked for Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer on the Active Directory and BPOS, where I wrote code that run in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

I received my PhD from IC/Unicamp, Brazil, and USI, Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. Edmundo Madeira and Fernando Pedone. As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.

In general, I like working on interesting problems and so far I've found plenty of them in distributed computing. If you want to know more about my research, please follow the link on the left pane.
