Abstract: Mechanism reduction is badly needed in large scale chemical simulations. Most graph based approaches, such as Directed Relation Graphs, derive the dependency of a species on all the others using single paths between them, which is not optimal. But since calculating the optimal solution has prohibitive costs, in this paper we propose the use of all the paths of a given large size to approximate the dependency.
