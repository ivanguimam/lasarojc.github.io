Abstract: This  paper  introduces  and  evaluates  a  Traffic  SignManagement Architecture (TSMA), which represents a paradigmshift  for  the  deployment  of  traffic  sign  infrastructure  in  thecontext of Intelligent Transport Systems, Vehicular Networks andSmart  Cities.  The  proposal  addresses  limitations  of  the  currenttraffic control model by enabling remote updates of traffic signsand  displaying  them  on  the  vehicular  navigation  system  displayto  improve  their  legibility.  TSMA  is  an  architecture  developedto  provide  V2I  interaction  using  a  commodity  technology,  Wi-Fi,  through  the  beacon-stuffing  technique.  The  initial  design  ofTSMAâ€™s  security  mechanisms  is  also  presented  in  this  paper.Evaluations   were   performed   on   a   developed   prototype   andsimulation  environments.
