Abstract: The massive deployment of Wireless Local Area Networks has made interference mitigation between neighboring networks a challenging issue. These uncoordinated access networks aim at improving their operation by choosing the best wireless channel available, characterizing a competition over the restricted set of possible channels. This work analyses this competition using Game Theory and Markov Chains models, showing that such competitive behavior can lead to Nash Equilibria and that outcomes mostly will not be maximal. Additionally, partially and fully cooperative models are proposed and evaluated, allowing (a) individual players to increase global results using arbitrarily computed and non-rational moves, and (b) achieving maximal outcomes when considering the cooperation of up to all players.
