Abstract: State machine replication is an approach to create fault tolerant dis-tributed systems.  The system remains corret while tolerating faults from someof its replicas.  These replicas must execute the same sequence of requests, aproblem that is solved by total order algorithsm like Raft.  some services mayneed that requests have different priority levels, such that some be executed be-fore others.  In this work, we propose an algorithm, PRaft, that introduces theidea of priority based state machine replication to Raft, modifying it to deal withrequest priority.
