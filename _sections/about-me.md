Welcome to my narcissistic corner on the Net.

I work as Distributed Systems Engineer for Hedvig Inc. and as an Associate Professor for the Computer Science Faculty @ Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia, where I co-founded the Distributed Systems and Networks research group.

Previously I have also worked as Software Development Engineer at Microsoft, where I worked on Active Directory and BPOS and wrote code running in the MS identity related cloud and in the most deployed directory service in the world.

I received my PhD from IC/Unicamp, Brazil, and USI, Switzerland, where I worked under the supervision of Profs. Edmundo Madeira and Fernando Pedone. As a PhD student I was a member of the Sprint project on high performance database replication.

In general, I like working on interesting problems and so far I've found plenty of them in distributed computing. If you want to know more about my research, please follow the link on the left pane.
